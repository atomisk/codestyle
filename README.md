## BEM syntax
- [Official site](https://en.bem.info)
- [MindBEMding â€“ getting your head â€™round BEM syntax](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) - a good primer with a few practical examples
- [Get BEM - FAQ](http://getbem.com/faq/) - to better understand why BEM matters and learn how to deal with common problems (e.g. nested elements, block modifier affecting elements, etc.)


- [CSSNext](http://cssnext.io)
- Some testing ideas: [csste.st](http://csste.st)
- I've been working off the [sass-lint defaults](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/blob/develop/lib/config/sass-lint.yml) in sublime for the past 18 months, would love to adapt this to csslint/csslint-next. Good, sane defaults.
